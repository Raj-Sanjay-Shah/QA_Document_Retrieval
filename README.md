# QA_Document_Retrieval

## Requirements
1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. Download questions from: [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpinafore-us-west-2%2Fqanta-jmlr-datasets%2Fqanta.train.2018.04.18.json&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGf7EtqkO16UWbMx_eeAexvvoIXxw] and save as 'qanta.train.json'. Users can also change the value of the variable 'questions_file' in test_queries.py to the correct path.
3. Download documents from: [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpinafore-us-west-2%2Fqanta-jmlr-datasets%2Fwikipedia%2Fwiki_lookup.json&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFJ_cCrB0wkRniaZ9yRWg7dvBslMw] and save as 'wiki_lookup.json'. Users can also change the value of the variable 'file_name_documents' in Index_Creation_code.py to the correct path.

## Steps to run the code:
1. Install all the requirements in the file requirements.txt by using the above code.
2. python run.py

## Document Retrieval
1. Index creation for tf-idf is done by the python file Index_Creation_code.py
2. Please note that location of files containing the corpus can be changed according to convenience
in the beginning of all the python files.
	- I have only retrieved the document titles while displaying the ranking. I assume that the titles are sufficient to identify the document. The top three documents are also stored in the for use in BERT-SQuAD.
The code of tf-idf is implemented from scratch to support the following improvements:
1. Spell checking.
2. Using synoynms for equivalence classes.
3. Using zone indexing to give weights to the title and the body.
### Results for retrieval
| : Case :  | : Accuracy : |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 1 results | 67%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 5 results | 80%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 10 results | 84%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 20 results | 84%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 30 results | 85%  |

| : Case when only the first sentence of the document is considered :  | : Accuracy : |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 1 results | 9%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 5 results | 20%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 10 results | 26%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 20 results | 30%  |
| If the model is considered to be accurate when the actual document is in the top 30 results | 36%  |

## Answering system
I use the BERT-SQuAD pre-trained model from here [https://github.com/kamalkraj/BERT-SQuAD]. Given a document and a question, this model gives specific answers with confidence levels.
